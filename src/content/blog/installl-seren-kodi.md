If you followed my [last guide](/posts/installing-kodi-plugins/), you'll understand the basics on installing a kodi plugin:

1. add a source
2. install a repository from a zip file located at the source configured in step 1.
3. install the plugin from the repository you installed in step 2.
4. configure a premium CDN service like [real-debrid.com](http://real-debrid.com/?id=1092085)

To install Seren and get it working, you'll need a [CDN service like real-debrid](http://real-debrid.com/?id=1092085) for less than 5$/month, this is completely worthwhile as it will replace all of your streaming service subscriptions, and it can do more than just provide fast sources for video on Kodi. 


The repository url for Seren is ` https://nixgates.github.io/packages`

Follow the steps from my previous guide, but use the ` https://nixgates.github.io/packages ` url for the repository zip file instead. 

Once you've installed the plugin, you'll need to configure the *Provider Tools* as follows

1. On the Seren homepage click *Tools*
2. Click *Provider Tools*
3. Click *Manage Provider Packages*
4. Click *Install Package*
5. Click *Web Location*
6. Enter `http://bit.ly/a4kScrapers` and click *OK*
7. Click *Install*
8. Click *OK*
9. Click *Close*

You've successfully configured the *Provider Packages*

Now you'll need to add your [Real Debrid](http://real-debrid.com/?id=1092085) account.

1. From the main menu click *Tools*
2. Click *Open Settings Menu*
3. Under *Accounts* Click *Enable Real Debrid*
4. Select *Authorize Real Debrid*
5. Go to the url `https://real-debrid.com/device` on any web browser and enter the code displayed in kodi
6. Congratulations, you're Done, you can configure other settings to filter your results and begin watching TV and movies.
