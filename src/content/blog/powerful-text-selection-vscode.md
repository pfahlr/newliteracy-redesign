VSCode has become one of the most popular IDEs in recent years. It is also
available for free. Here are a few text selection options of which you may
not be aware.

## Multiple Selections

It is possible to create multiple cursors and selections in Visual Studio. Holding down the `Alt` key while clicking on different regions of the document will add additional cursors. In the same manner, `Alt+Up` and `Alt+Down` adds cursor on adjacent lines.

## Selection of Columns

It's a common operation to select individual rows of text, but you don't often see the ability to select columns. It may not be something that's often needed, but when it is, it's certain to save a lot of time. In Visual Studio Code, it is possible to select multiple columns of text by placing the cursor on the column from which the selection will begin, holding `Shift+Alt`, and then dragging the selection with a mouse.
