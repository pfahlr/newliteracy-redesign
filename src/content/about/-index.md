We build websites that don’t just look good — they work hard.
**New Literacy Media Group** is a boutique web design and data agency focused on helping businesses grow through intelligent design, search visibility, and custom-built tools for data scraping and analysis.

I started this agency after years of seeing businesses struggle to connect the dots between beautiful websites and real results. Our mission is to **bridge the gap between content, code, and competitive insight**.

From local SEO-optimized websites to lead-generating scraping tools and subscription-based market intelligence platforms like [TaxDeedReports.com](https://taxdeedreports.com), everything we do is about helping our clients win with better information and smarter systems.
